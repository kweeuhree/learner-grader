<h2>SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
<h5>Summary:</h5>
<p>This repository contains a code solution to a Skills Based Assessment on JavaScript Fundamentals.</p>
<p><code>getLearnerData()</code> takes three arguments that have to be entered without typos, as input undergoes basic validation.</p>
<p>The main logic revolves around Learner class, that holds individually relevant information. All instances of class are kept in a static <code>instances</code> array.</p>
<p>The code is fragmented into functions which in turn allows for easier testing.</p>
<p><code>IsDueInTheFuture()</code> is used in two other functions: <code>populateAllScores()</code>, and <code>getMaxScore()</code>. This is a very simple function that does only one thing: based on a parameter, it checks whether due date of an assignment is in the future.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Declared variables properly using let and const where appropriate.</li>
<li>Used different operators, such as logical operators (ex. <code>getMaxScore()</code>), comparison operators (ex. <code>isSubmittedOnTime()</code>), arithmetic operators (ex. <code>populateAverageScore()</code>).</li>
<li>Used strings, numbers, and Boolean values cached within variables.</li>
<li>Used multiple if/else statements to control program flow.</li>
<li>Used try/catch statements to manage potential invalid data being fed into the program.</li>
<li>Utilizing multiple for loops and a while loop.</li>
<li>Utilizing loop control keyword continue (ex. <code>populateAllScores()</code>).</li>
<li>Created and manipulated arrays and objects.</li>
<li>Demonstrated the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object.</li>
